 As u can see i made a full form just like the sales/new on osuna, make it to render the clientForm when creating new client under, just as it did with electrodomesticos form, and on this ClientForm make it easier removing the status field, make it active by default, remove the CI/Id and set it t null, and remove Gps Lat and Long, so the goal is making it render not as a dialog because this could lead if closed the dialog by mistake lose data, so better render as a form, i advice to just create a new ClientForm this way u can remove the fields im telling u

 - On this same form we have electrodomesticos, they no longer will have modelo and numero de Serie, remove those fields and change it for notas, a text area will appear instead optional, where u can add more specifications and anything u need about the electrodomesticos
 On the rendered electrodomesticos that belong to cliente, make it popover select


 - And make the ordenForm being more perfomant and super easy to fill, rn is easy but make it more more easy as this is filled while taking a phone call, and make it more perfomant, currently it has old bloat

 Of course this orden form im referring is the one on /orden
